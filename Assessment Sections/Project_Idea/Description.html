 <h1> Description of the Project </h1>
 <br>
 
 <p>
    The app will have various categories that relate to everyday homes. Each category will have many different sections that the user
    will be able to select. The sections will expand to a list of problems. When the user selects a problem there will be a page outlining 
	the issues with multiple solutions and with a detail step by step guide. There will also be multiple tabs that can be selected.
	<br>
	First will be the overview of the problem which will include the solutions and additional information in written format (includes pictures as well). 
	<br>
	The second tab will be a video tutorial on how to solve the problem. The information present in the overview/solution and video tab 
	will be outsourced from recommended sources with acknowledgement to respected sources. 
	<br>
	The last tab will be a discussion/forum page for users to discuss and be able to provide additional information 
	or seek help from moderators or other users.
 </p>

 <p>
    The app will also include a suggestion component that will allow users to contact the app moderators with ideas for current issues that they 
	want addressed or to provide addition solutions to already existing problems. If a user wishes to post in forums or provide suggestions, 
	they will have to create an account by either using google account or using their email. Creating account will allow users to create a profile for 
	themselves as well in the profile section. The user profile will include; profile pictures, usernames, description, and user ratings. 
	The user ratings system will be a user interactive system between the community. Users will be able to rate other user’s helpfulness 
	on individual forum posts. Each user will also be able to view profiles of other users which will also link them to all their forum post. 
	The forum post will be organised in the categories which users can select to be directed to the post. All forum post will be managed with profanity
	filtering AI (Artificial Intelligence) as well as being monitored by moderators regularly. If a user has a problem another user’s post, 
	they can report that user on that user's profile page. The report will be sent to the moderators and thank the user for submitting the report. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
    Under the profile on the side bar will be a settings tab. Settings will include: account, language, display, User agreement, privacy policy, 
	content policy, help centre, report an issue, and build information. The account section will allow users that are not logged in to login which
	will lead to a sign in page that can also be used to create an account or to recover forgotten information. If the user is logged in then 
	the profile tab will allow them to logout or change their password (if selected leading to a password reset screen). The language tab is to
	change the app language to any language. Display tab will let user’s change to dark or light mode. The policy tabs will let the user view 
	each different policies or agreements in their entirely. The report an issue section is for users to report problems with the app’s technical abilities.

    The app will also include a cooking section which will include recipes, food storage hacks and essential utensils for the kitchen. 
	For each recipe, the user can change the portion sizes and find where they are able to purchase these ingredients by using an embedded grocery
	store interface. Through this you can compare prices and if you can buy it at that store. Alongside this we will advertise people’s recipes for
	a monthly subscription. If an applicable video is available, it will also be embedded into the tutorials. Sub sections for recipes will be added

 </p>
 
 <p>
    Another category that will be added is about maintain your pool.
    The first thing you must do daily is skim the surface of your pool which takes about ten minutes and keeps the water clean. It is important to remove leaves and dirt from the surface of the water, so it doesn't sink to the bottom and stain the pool floor. 
    Once the dirt has been brushed from the walls to the floor, they can be then vacuumed by an automatic pool vacuum, along with any other dirt that has floated from the surface to the bottom and always keep your filtration system running to clean thew water.
   Lastly regularly check the chemicals in the pool to make sure no bacteria are growing.
