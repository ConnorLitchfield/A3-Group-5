<h2> Cyber Security - How will this effect you </h2>

<p>Technology has become increasingly important in our lives and this large reliance will make us more exposed to cybercrime in terms
 of data security and privacy such as hacking, malware, identity theft, financial fraud, medical information, and other offences that
 expose our personal information, messages, images and video and audio recordings without our approval or permission.</p>

<p>In the next few years, cybersecurity will gain increasing importance as our society and life becomes more technologically dependent. 
Identifiable information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, and bank account numbers are publicly displayed on social media accounts. 
Cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive are now used to store sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers,
 and bank account numbers.</p>
 
<p>Personally, I use the cloud storage from Google Drive, Google photos, Google Document, and all other Google services to save and keep my personal data, 
 my folders and my family and friends photos and videos and that’s help me to restore them whatever my mobile have problem or even buy a new one.
 As well as I use Google Drive to sync my RMIT subjects and assessment and without a cybersecurity program, my data and personal information 
 will be irresistible target for cybercriminals. </p>
 
<p>Cybersecurity will allow me to protect and recover my computer system, network, devices, and the programs from any type of cyber-attack. 
 It will protect my data, folders, photos and videos and all other categories of data from theft and damage. This includes sensitive data, 
 personally identifiable information, and my personal information. </p>
 
<p>As a student I can’t have a dedicated cybersecurity team, the cybercriminals may easily attack my computer and devices, that will make my data vulnerable
 to cyberattacks including data theft and ransomware. Most of my family members and friends aren’t aware of the risk of cyber-attacks, 
 they use their devices daily in their life, the usage of these devices alone makes them vulnerable to these attacks.</p>

<p>These malware programs are often disguised by cybercriminals and sold in official app stores, where they blend into legitimate apps seamlessly 
and the users aren’t aware of the threats posed by these cyber-attacks. </p>
