<h2>Cyber Security and its likely impact.</h2>

<p>Cyber security will always be a major concern, cyber-attacks continue to grow exponentially and show no sign of stopping or slowing.</p>

<p>The impact of this is loss of data and monetary loss, not only can a large company lose a massive amount of money to a Ransome ware
attack but can loos private data that could be leaked to media or public resulting in what could be irreparable reputation loss.</p>

<p>Cyber security attacks especially in the cloud computing sector will continue to grow, as more and more cloud computing is becoming the new normal. 
This has been accelerated by covid19 as more and more businesses are jumping on the cloud computing band wagon. At this point it’s not so much a matter 
of if but when and how you recover.</p>

<p>The most vulnerable people to this are businesses and their reputation, if a large medical firm was to lose medical records this could spell 
disaster, no one would want to store their data with this organization again. One of these large Organizations or governments could be hit with a ransomware 
attack that could cost them millions, imaging a situation where your organization has lost 1 million or more personal records, bank details names credit card 
numbers, now you are being told pay up or else. Most companies without a backup plan could be in for a lot of trouble and won’t have a legal leg to stand on 
because many organized criminal cyber hacking groups are government sanctioned. That’s right governments worldwide are paying people to do this, sometimes 
for monetary gain sometimes for political gain.</p>

<p>Cyber security stands to create many more jobs soon not only for new people willing
to put in the efforts and gain the qualification, but for old hats too who are
willing to upgrade their certifications, it is certainly not a job sector that
is going away any time soon.</p>
