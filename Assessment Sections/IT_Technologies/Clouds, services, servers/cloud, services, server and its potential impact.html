<h2> cloud, services, server and its potential impact </h2>

<p>With the spread of cloud, services, server, companies were encouraged to outsource most of their IT needs. 
Third-party vendors will invest in hardware and software and make technology -based serviced available to businesses online. 
Instead of a company paying for a its IT department to be upgraded regularly, they can purchase cloud services as needed. 
This type of outsourcing reduced the upfront investment in technology that was required to enter the new market and or to stay relevant. 
By using cloud services, a small business can offer the same customer service interface as a large business and deliver a product that delivers the same quality 
to customers. The cloud, services and servers have also positive impact on the economics of these businesses. It provides many economic incentives and 
other benefits that can help enhance the company’s total value and revenue and help saves cost, with minimal money spent on training employees</p>

<p>Reduced cost is the greatest impact about moving to the cloud services. This also eliminates the need for server hardware because everything is 
available and hosted on the cloud server and this helps reduce hardware costs and helps with new innovations.</p>

<p>In addition, the company can quickly increase or decrease their operating and storage requirements, with the use of the cloud services the business will not 
have to buy expensive updates for every machine, the cloud, services, server’s provider will manage this for the business. Thus, it will have impact on the 
deployment of the project which means the cloud-based applications take less time to achieve the set goal, most cloud applications can be downloaded immediately 
upon registration, and the cloud provides fast application deployment. Due to the availability of the cloud services on the internet, it enables employees to
 access files from anywhere in the world at any time and allows them to work remotely, this reduces office space expenses. </p>
 
 <p>Though, there is a negative affect this can be dependency on the cloud, services, server. The service supplier can impose complete dependence on the 
 service to access your data stored on their servers.  If something was to go wrong or the service requested you pay a higher price for your service, 
 due to the closed environment nature of these cloud services getting your data back could be difficult if not impossible.</p>
 
 <p>There is also a risk of loss of data when your system and software are uploaded to the cloud because the cloud, services, server are not 
 able to provide all the needs of the user. This can be compounded with lack of technical knowledge and experience in dealing with the software, 
 this makes data loss more likely and can make life very difficult for users who aren’t so adept with current technologies.</p>
 
 <p>The adoption of this technology in the future will affect the labour market in information technology. Job seekers who have experience working with
 cloud-based services will have an advantage, along with people who are flexible enough to weather the transition to greater reliance on 
 third-party partnerships.</p>
